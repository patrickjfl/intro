        <p class="text">I may not sound it, but I'm actually Welsh.  So far I've lived life as a bit of a nomad, growing up in mid-Wales before living in Oxford and London, and most recently, Barcelona. <br><br>
            I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at university, before doing a Master's in History.  It turned out that these qualifications weren't actually all that useful in getting a job (shocker, I know).  Since then I have been working as a trade union organiser and a teacher.  I've been looking for a new challenge for a while and I'm <em>really</em> excited to be part of the School of Code Bootcamp's 4th cohort!</p>

           <p class="text"> I love football, both playing and <a href="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/15/29/liverpool-premier-league-2019-20_1r738vph5fzoc13bjqdcrwz2ex.jpg?t=2037924915&quality=100">supporting</a>.  And <a href="https://youtu.be/C9ZnTB7SQbQ">ping pong</a>.  I'm also into socialising and meeting new people, travelling and learning languages.  I'm slightly eccentric when it comes to yoga and meditation.  More so in terms of obsessively following politics.  And even more so with playing Irish trad music, on the guitar and - wait for it - <a href="https://youtu.be/pxp5QRXofV4">the spoons</a>.<br><br>
            Covid permitting, I'm always game for meeting up IRL.  I'm also keen to help make the whispers of regular SoC football a reality...</p>
